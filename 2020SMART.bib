	abstract = {We describe the slice spectral sequence of a 32-periodic C -spectrum K[ ] related to the C norm MU((C )) = NCC MUℝ of the real cobordism spectrum MUℝ. We will give it as a spectral sequence of Mackey functors converging to the graded Mackey functor π∗K[ ], complete with differentials and exotic extensions in the Mackey functor structure. The slice spectral sequence for the 8-periodic real K-theory spectrum Kℝ was first analyzed by Dugger. The C analog of K[ ] is 256-periodic and detects the Kervaire invariant classes θj. A partial analysis of its slice spectral sequence led to the solution to the Kervaire invariant problem, namely the theorem that θj does not exist for j ≥ .},
